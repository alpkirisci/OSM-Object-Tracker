DONE
+ "Add/Delete pdf" fuctionality on chapter page
+ After a course is selected that course's existing chapters needs to be displayed
+ Generate video:
    * the update chapter endpoint needs to be seperated
    * if pdf related info changes only video should be updated
    * if script changes both audio and video should be updated
+ There should be a loading screen
+ A prompt needs to be able to produce more than one chapter:
    * Samet Abi suggested first a prompt to get titles and abouts of chapters as a python array
    * Then from that array prompts to produce scripts
    * Makes sense
+ Video needs to be downloadable
+ Fix chapter reordering
+ Current css is wrong practice fix it
+ Dark mode added
